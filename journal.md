## June 18: A start

Log-01: 1 hour drawing, 2 hours brainstorming

I've had this idea in my head about creating a organization system using low power gadgets, that can light up to show where specific things are.

The problem: I don't know where a tool/item is
Solution: Type it into a database and send out the RF signal to light up the tag.

I've also completed many sketches attempting to theorize fun build templates.

Components:

- Charging module
- Overcharge & Battery Overuse Protection
- GPIO Interrupt RF Module

This build will feature a heavily steampunk inspired style! I'm planning to build it all without the gauge, but if I feel like adding it later, then I might. (Right now its just too large in scope)
