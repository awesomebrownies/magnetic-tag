## June 18: The Steam Valve

Log-01: 1 hour drawing, 3 hours research

The steam valve is about creating an items logistics system using low power gadgets, that can light up to show where specific things are. It solves the problem of organization nightmare. This handy little tally keeps track of when you don't put back items. It also works as a quick way to find things, since all items are logged into a database.

Let's talk items! To keep with the steampunk vibe, I'll be using mechanical gears, stylized 3d parts, springs, and more!
* Gear assembly + load gauge
  *  Motor & motor controller slave device
* Computing
  * Master microcontroller (wall power & shelf control)

I have a lot of different little shelves, so the plan is to create 10 of these, and 3 microcontrollers for the three sections of my room. I'll also code up a database system for logging where objects are!
